    <h3>Home/ Main Map</h3>
    <p>Have you heard that the United States also owns many islands somewhere in the Pacific but know little or nothing about them?  Is Puerto Rico Part of the US?  I have often read wikipedia articles and wondered around the internet looking for information regarding the United States' insular territories.  But I have yet to come across a resource that aggregates many different resources so that comprehending these territories in both their geographic and legal sense can be achieved in an organized way.  Their are may great sites out there focused on these islands as individuals but my aim is to group them together in one place, on one map, so that you can see where they are quickly and then using a map with wikipedia pages overlayed by location get a good background knowledge of their geography, legal status, and culture.</p>

    
    <p>By making this knowledge building exercise and investigation easier and more graphically pleasing, with the aid of maps and Google’s satellite imagery, I am hoping to raise awareness of the United States’ Insular territories and the many struggles they face today in the legal gray area that many of them exist in.   Also besides the 5 inhabited islands there are — uninhabited islands which have been drastically affected by nuclear testing and now global warming.  The largest nature preserve in the United States, Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, is located near the Midway Atoll and the environmental realities facing many of these islands is pressing harder and harder at our consciousness.</p>
